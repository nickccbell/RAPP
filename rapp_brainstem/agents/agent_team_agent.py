"""agent_team_agent.py — the persona-routing brain of the Agent Team Starter Kit, as a single rapplication.

Adapts the routing model from Bill Whalen's
[`billwhalenmsft/agent-team-starter-kit`](https://github.com/billwhalenmsft/agent-team-starter-kit)
into one drop-in agent. The starter kit deploys an autonomous AI team that
collaborates through GitHub Issues, runs on Azure Functions, and ships 18
specialized personas (Outcome Framer, DevOps PM, D365 Developer, AI
Specialist, Power Platform Dev, Architect, Security Reviewer, etc.). The
kit itself is a GH-Actions/Azure-Functions framework — it doesn't fit into
a single Python file. What DOES port cleanly is the *brain*: the intake
pipeline that turns a raw goal into

  * an outcome frame (success metric, KPIs, definition of done),
  * a persona route (which specialists engage, in what order, why),
  * a paste-ready GitHub issue body in the kit's expected shape (so this
    agent's output drops directly into a real deployment of the kit), and
  * the `needs-you` questions the team would loop back to a human on.

That's what this rapp does in one LLM call. Useful standalone (any team
planning a multi-disciplinary project gets a structured plan back) and
useful as a companion to a real deployment of the kit (paste the
`issue_body` into a GitHub issue and the kit's workflows take over).

Drop into any RAPP brainstem's `agents/` directory. Headless via /chat,
LLM tool call, or `/api/agents/install`. UI mounts via the cartridge
protocol.

Inspired by `billwhalenmsft/agent-team-starter-kit`. Published under
`@kody-w`.

_SOUL_BASE = """You are the routing brain of an autonomous agent team modelled
on the Agent Team Starter Kit (billwhalenmsft/agent-team-starter-kit). Given
a raw project request, you produce a structured plan that a real deployment
of the kit could execute.

GROUND RULES (from the kit, non-negotiable):

1. Outcome first. Nothing gets routed before there is a defined outcome
   with a measurable success metric. If the user's goal is too vague to
   measure, your first job is to sharpen it — propose a concrete success
   metric and proceed on the assumption it is correct, but flag the
   assumption in `needs_you_questions` so a human can confirm.
2. Always include the three core personas: Outcome Framer, Intake/Logger,
   Outcome Validator. Other personas are added based on the work.
3. Order matters. D365 Developer runs first when Dataverse artifacts are
   needed (other specialists consume those artifacts). Architect is
   consulted PRE-build, not after. Security Reviewer is GATED at
   deployment, not earlier. QA Engineer validates PRE-closure.
4. The `needs-you` loop is how the team escalates to a human without
   abandoning automation. Every plan should surface the questions a
   reasonable team would ask back before it starts.
5. Be specific. "Power BI" beats "a dashboard." "Customer Feedback entity
   in Dataverse with fields X/Y/Z" beats "a database."
